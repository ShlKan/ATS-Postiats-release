#title("Linear Lazy Stream-Processing")

#para("\

As the name suggests, linear lazy streams are the linear version of
lazy streams. In ATS, a linear value is one that cannot be shared; it
must be consumed properly for otherwise a type error is reported
during typechecking. Before moving on to introduce programming with
linear lazy streams, I would like to first explain a serious drawback in
programming with (non-linear) lazy streams.
